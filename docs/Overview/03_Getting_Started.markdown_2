Communicating with OlegDB is done via a pretty simple `REST` interface.
You `POST` to create/update records, `GET` to retrieve them, `DELETE` to delete,
and `HEAD` to get back some information about them. Probably.

For example, to store the value `Raphael` into the database named `turtles` under
the key `red` you could use something like the following:

````
$ curl -X POST -d 'Raphael' http://localhost:8080/turtles/red
````

Retrieving data is just as simple:

````
$ curl http://localhost:8080/turtles/red
````

Deleting keys can be done by using DELETE:

````
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/turtles/red
````

OlegDB supports lazy key expiration. You can specify an expiration date by setting the
`X-OlegDB-use-by` header to a *UTC* POSIX timestamp.

````
$ curl -X POST \
-H "X-OlegDB-use-by: $(date +%s)" \
-d '{turtle: "Johnny", age: 34}' http://localhost:8080/turtles/Johnny
&gt; POST /turtles/Johnny HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0
&gt; Host: localhost:8080
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt; X-OlegDB-use-by: 1394323192
&gt; Content-Type: application/octet-stream
&gt; Content-Length: 27
&gt;
\* upload completely sent off: 27out of 27 bytes
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Server: OlegDB/fresh_cuts_n_jams
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt; Connection: close
&lt; Content-Length: 7
&lt;
無駄
````

And then when we try to get it back out again:

````
$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/turtles/Johnny
&gt; GET /turtles/Johnny HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0
&gt; Host: localhost:8080
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
&lt; Status: 404 Not Found
&lt; Server: OlegDB/fresh_cuts_n_jams
&lt; Content-Length: 26
&lt; Connection: close
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt;
These aren't your ghosts.
````

As you can hopefully tell, the POST succeeds and a 200 OK is returned. We
used the bash command `date +%s` which returns a timestamp. Then, immediately
trying to access the key again results in a 404, because the key expired.

If you want to retrieve the expiration date of a key, you can do so by sending HEAD:

````
$ curl -v -X HEAD http://localhost:8080/turtles/Johnny
&gt; HEAD /turtles/Johnny HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&gt; Host: localhost:8080
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
\* Server OlegDB/fresh_cuts_n_jams is not blacklisted
